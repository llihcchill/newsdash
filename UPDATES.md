things that should be done

 - [x] login page
        -> just has a username (could add passwords and stuff but
            not now)
 - [x] create server page
        -> have a list show up when logged in with username

 - [] have it themed in the 20's, newspapers, bunch of old timey stuff

 - [] 1 js file for 1 page (with multiple components as necessary)
        -> can't be completed for now, but someday I might fix MIME type imports and be able to do this
