things that should be done:

 - [x] login page
        -> just has a username (could add passwords and stuff but
            not now)
       
 - [x] create server page
        -> have a list show up when logged in with username

 - [ ] have it themed in the 20's, newspapers, bunch of old timey stuff
        -> very much for later when all the functionalities have been completed

 - [ ] have public and private servers
